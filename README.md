# Overview of the analysis: The purpose is well defined (2 pt)
Dana is a data journalist that is writing about UFO sightings in her hometown, McMinnville, OR. Starting only with a data file of UFO sightings, she wants to display the data in a table and then positing it online in a tidy html page that has filter interactivity.
These filters will provide multiple criteria options for more granularity based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
The UFO Sightings website was created for the curious science fiction enthusiast that is looking to dive a little deeper into rumors and conspiracy theories revolving around the existence of extra-terrestrial beings and whether or not science fiction is in reality facts based on numerous sightings. The website is designed for easy use and interactivity. To navigate the listed sightings, you will see on the left side of the page a set of simple filtering options that allow you to explore the sightings based on Date, City, State, Country, and Shape:

Additionally, there are options to filter on Duration and Comments to offer further perspective on the event that took place.

As an example, let’s say you live in Southern California, and you’ve heard your friends discuss some strange, unexplainable events that were witnessed in the sky that involved bright lights. As a huge X-Files fan, your curiosity has gotten the best of you and wanted to see if this was an isolated event or one that has happened before.
Initially you just type in “ca” for California in the State field. From the results, you can see that there have been many sightings throughout the state (~30).

Wanting to get more specific, you add in “San Diego” in the City field. This narrows the search down to three results.

As shown above, the website and filtering options are easy to navigate and provide a deeper dive into first-hand accounts of UFO sightings.

## Summary: The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt); The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)
Although happy with the results and functionality of the UFO Sightings website, it does have its limitations. 
First off, the sightings are limited to a two-week time period from Jan. 1, 2010-Jan. 13, 2010.
Secondly, the data is 100% reliable. You will notice some of the comments identifying a few of the encounters as elaborate hoaxes…so who’s to say that more of these sightings aren’t hoaxes as well? One sighting from 1/1/10 in Naples, FL took place during a fireworks display, which would easily compromise the validity of the experienced events recorded.
Lastly, the data only reflects sightings within the United States.
As a recommendation for further development, I would suggest:
1.	Expanding the data to include other countries. This would validate that the sightings aren’t just an American phenomenon inspired by years of conspiracy theories and government mystery and intrigue.
2.	Expand that range of dates. This would offer further insight into the idea that UFO sightings have been something that mankind have been experiencing for decades long before the present day.
